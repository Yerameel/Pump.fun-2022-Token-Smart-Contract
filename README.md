## Overview

The **Pump.fun 2022 Token Smart Contract** is a powerful tool designed for the Solana blockchain. It implements a bonding curve model, similar to the popular Pumpfun model, allowing users to engage in a dynamic token economy. This contract also integrates with Raydium's Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM), enhancing liquidity and trading capabilities.

## Features

- **Bonding Curve Mechanism**: Users can buy and sell tokens based on a predefined bonding curve.
- **Integration with Raydium**: Seamlessly migrate tokens to Raydium's CPMM for enhanced liquidity.
- **Tax Token Model**: Implements a tax mechanism for transactions, promoting sustainable growth.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with usability in mind, making it easy for developers and users to interact with the contract.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yerameel/Pump.fun-2022-Token-Smart-Contract.git
cd Pump.fun-2022-Token-Smart-Contract
npm install
```

Make sure you have the Solana CLI installed. You can find installation instructions on the [Solana documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

## Usage

After installation, you can deploy the smart contract to the Solana network. Follow these steps:

1. Set up your Solana wallet and configure it with the CLI.
2. Compile the smart contract:

   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

3. Deploy the contract:

   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```

4. Interact with the contract using the provided scripts or your preferred interface.

For detailed interaction instructions, refer to the scripts in the `scripts` folder.

## Smart Contract Structure

The smart contract consists of several key components:

- **Token Management**: Handles token minting, burning, and transfers.
- **Bonding Curve Logic**: Implements the mathematical model for buying and selling tokens.
- **Tax Mechanism**: Defines how transaction taxes are calculated and distributed.

### Key Files

- `lib.rs`: Main contract logic.
- `token.rs`: Token management functions.
- `curve.rs`: Bonding curve calculations.
- `tax.rs`: Tax calculation functions.

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contract, ensure you are connected to the correct Solana cluster (devnet, testnet, or mainnet). Use the following command to set your cluster:

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Replace the URL with the appropriate cluster endpoint for your deployment.

## Testing

To ensure the contract works as expected, run the test suite included in the repository:

```bash
anchor test
```

This command will execute all tests and report any issues. Make sure to fix any failing tests before deploying to the mainnet.

## Tokenomics

The tokenomics of the Pump.fun 2022 Token is designed to promote long-term growth and stability:

- **Initial Supply**: The total supply of tokens at launch.
- **Tax Rate**: A percentage of each transaction that goes to a community fund.
- **Liquidity Pool**: A portion of tokens is allocated to liquidity on Raydium.

### Example Token Distribution

| Category            | Percentage |
|---------------------|------------|
| Initial Supply      | 50%        |
| Community Fund      | 20%        |
| Liquidity Pool      | 30%        |
